Overview
Word-clouds are a mechanism for creating a visual representation of text and are used to
display a visual summary of the most prominent words used on a web page, a news forum or
a social media web site. A word-cloud is comprised of a set of tags, with each tag
representing a single word. The prominence of a word is typically estimated from its
occurrence frequency in a text and is visualised using a large font size or different font colour.
You are required to develop a Java Word-Cloud API that can parse a file or a URL to
generate a PNG (portable network graphics) file with a word-cloud displaying the most
prominent words in decreasing font size, style and colour. Note that your API should ignore
frequently occurring words and HTML tags, in the case of a word-cloud generated abstraction from a
URL. A list of common words is provided in the file stopwords.txt.
The whole point of this assignment is for you to demonstrate an understanding of the
principles of object-oriented design by using abstraction, encapsulation, composition,
inheritance and polymorphism WELL throughout the application. Hence, you are also
required to provide a UML diagram of your design and to JavaDoc your code. Please pay
particular attention to how your application must be packaged and submitted. Marks will be
deducted if you deviate (even slightly...) from the requirements. Finally, as 4 th year software
students, you should appreciate that, if your code does not compile you cannot pass the abstraction
